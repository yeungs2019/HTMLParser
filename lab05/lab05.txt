1. a) Output is 32.
   b) y's value is the memory address of x.
   c) x, y, z are in static
DPW: Stack, -5

2. a) Output is 200.
   b) x. y, z are in stack
   c) In int *x, making double pointers in the same line seems consuming.

3. a) Memory address of x.
   b) x and z are in heap
   c) x and z
   d) Z is just assigned to a value in x. And the memory of z is not deleted

4. a) The output is 20 because it is known that x is incrementing by 1 each time
   b) delete x;
   c) delete y;

5. a) The value of x is 10 and value of y is 90.
   b) The memory addresses of x and y.
   c) (*z)[10] dereferencing z at index 10 in the array.
   d) They are different because z was assigned two different memory addresses.
   e) delete x; delete y;

6. a) Undefined
   b) GPAs of Students
   c) GPAs of students were being sorted
   d) int take less bytes, while strings take more bytes. Ints just take up less memory than strings, which makes running the program faster.
   e) delete students; delete studentsPtr;
